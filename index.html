        date: "29/01/2026",
        content: `Morocco has formally notified the World Trade Organization (TWO) about the initiation of a safeguard review on possible extension of the safeguard measure on hot-rolled steel sheet, Kallanish notes.

The investigation covers hot-rolled steel sheet, whether in coils or not, classified under Moroccan customs tariff codes 7208, 721113, 721114, 721119, 722530, 722540, 7226200011, 7226200020, 7226200051, 7226200052, 7226200059, 722691 and 7226998000. 

The review investigation was opened on 22 January by Morocco’s Ministry of Industry and Commerce, following a request from Maghreb Steel, which represents the domestic producing industry.

According to the notification, the review was launched on the grounds that the safeguard measure remains necessary to remedy and prevent serious injury, and that the domestic industry is still completing adjustment efforts to improve competitiveness. Moreover, import pressure could intensify in the absence of the measure due to global capacity growth and the proliferation of trade-defence measures worldwide.

Interested parties have 30 days from the opening date to register and submit written comments to the Morocco's Ministry of Industry and Commerce.`,

        title: "SSAB highlights minimal US tariff impact",
        date: "29/01/2026",
        content: `SSAB, which operates production sites in Europe and the USA, has so far seen only a limited direct impact of the US steel tariffs, chief executive Johnny Sjöström said during a conference call this week.

He underlined how SSAB is well-positioned with significant local production in the US. Only a limited volume of special products, especially high-strength steels for the automotive industry, are exported from the Nordics and shipped to North America, and many other overseas locations. 

Recently, “we have been selling some more volumes of special steels to the USA, but we don’t have to,” he said. If demand in the USA should go down, the group can divert deliveries to Europe easily, Kallanish heard him say during the call.

SSAB’s US operations at its SSAB Americas division were the main driver behind the group’s improved operating result of SEK 756 million ($86m) in the fourth quarter 2025, up from SEK 486m in Q4 2026. The group notes its strong position in the US heavy plate market was a notable factor that supported the result.

Over the full year, figures saw a year-on-year decline, due to lower steel prices in the group’s main regions. Operating profit fell by SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 6.1 billion, on revenue that dipped by SEK 7.2 billion to SEK 96 billion.

The group’s international setup and the global customer base for its special products are an advantage in principle. However, the nominal figures quoted in a strengthening Swedish krona are affected by a depreciated US dollar, in which most transactions are defined.

Shipments rose slightly at all three divisions, totalling 3.29 million tonnes at SSAB Europe, 1.84mt at SSAB Americas, and 1.24mt at SSAB Special Steels.

For the first quarter this year, the group predicts higher shipments for Europe and Special Steels, and slightly higher sales at Americas, which last year saw the highest volume increase. Prices are expected to climb “somewhat higher” than in Q4, except for Special Steels, which is subject to different market dynamics, and where price hikes will take effect with a delay (see Kallanish 29 January).`,

        content: `Voestalpine has agreed to divest Böhler Profil, a company in its High Performance Metals division, supplier of special profiles for a variety of industrial applications including industrial knives, Kallanish learns.

The buyer is US company Kadant, based in Webford, Massachusetts, with 3,900 employees in 22 countries worldwide. According to voestalpine, Kadant will retain the unit’s staff working at the production site in Bruckbach, Lower Austria.

The Austrian group is divesting the unit for strategic reasons and in line with the streamlining of the High Performance Metals division portfolio. “Kadant had repeatedly expressed interest in the company,” chief executive Herbert Eibensteiner notes on the occasion of the sale agreement.

In the business year 2024/25, Böhler Profil had a workforce of approximately 150 employees and generated revenue of €51.5 million ($61.6m). Over the past 15 years, voestalpine has invested a total of €23m in the Bruckbach site, for purposes including upgrading automation and digitalisation in profile manufacturing, the group highlights.

The spin-off follows the divestment of another unit of High Performance Metals, Buderus Edelstahl in Wetzlar, Germany, as well as site consolidations outside Austria, and capacity adjustments at voestalpine Böhler Bleche. With these measures, the High Performance Metals division has effectively completed the process of restructuring its portfolio, voestalpine states.`,

GPI can be used as oxygen converter coolant or as feedstock for electric arc furnaces, cupolas and induction furnaces.

TMC plans to reach its design capacity for granulated iron production by 2028. According to the project, the plant will have a capacity of 332,500 tonnes/year. Construction and installation work is expected to be completed in 2027, Kallanish notes.

Product is planned to be delivered by road to nearby consumers in Bashkortostan, the Volga Federal District, and the Urals Federal District, which have their own iron or steel furnaces.

Products for export to the CIS countries and China will be delivered by road and then transferred to rail for final delivery. The investor has reached preliminary agreements with consumers in Russia and China.`,

        content: `Chinese wire rod export prices fluctuated in January under the impact of the newly introduced export licencing policy. They initially rose in early January before retreating with weak demand, and then stabilised till the end of the month.

Kallanish assessed 6.5mm diameter mesh-grade wire rod at $475/tonne fob China, remaining stable on-week.

Wire rod export prices saw less movement towards the end of the month as overseas buying interest softened and China's construction steel market slipped into its pre-Lunar New Year lull. Most Chinese traders are offering wire rod export prices at $475-485/t fob China, for March shipment. 

Some traders also tell Kallanish they are looking for short-selling windows to lower shipment costs and attract buyers. However, VAT-evading wire rod export transactions appear to have almost disappeared from the market.

As China approaches the Lunar New Year holiday, logistics and port activity are expected to slow, implying a further weakening in wire rod export activity.`,

        title: "Domestic demand anchors India steel growth: economic survey",
        date: "29/01/2026",
        content: `India’s steel sector remains structurally demand-led, supported by infrastructure spending and construction demand, while major producers ramp up capacities, even as trade and input risks intensify.

The steel sector serves as the "backbone" of industrialisation and infrastructure, securing India’s position as the world's second-largest crude steel producer, according to the Economic Survey 2025-26 seen by Kallanish. The sector has undergone a "major transformation" in the last five years, primarily driven by strong domestic demand from the construction and manufacturing sectors.

Crude steel output has risen from 103.54 million tonnes in the fiscal year ending March 2021 (FY21) to 152.18mt in FY25, equivalent to a 10.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Finished steel production increased from 96.2mt to 146.69mt over the same period, implying 11.1% CAGR.

Steel consumption has grown even more rapidly, up from 94.89mt in FY21 to 152.13mt in FY25, translating into a 12.5% CAGR. This reflects sustained demand from infrastructure, housing and manufacturing.

Momentum carried into FY26. In the first half of FY26, crude steel production increased 11.7% on-year, finished steel output rose 10.8%, while consumption expanded 7.8%.

External pressures have also emerged. The survey flags pricing and raw material risks, noting: “The sector faces challenges related to international price disparity and raw material security. India was a net importer of steel during FY26 (April-October), primarily due to low international prices which resulted in lower margins on exports and cheaper imports.”

Raw material security remains a structural constraint. While India is largely self-sufficient in iron ore, dependence on imported coking coal persists. To mitigate supply risks, the government’s Mission Coking Coal is targeting domestic raw coking coal production of 140mt by 2030 (see separate article).

Policy support remains central to the sector’s medium-term positioning. Under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for specialty steel, cumulative investment reached INR 230.22 billion ($2.5 billion) by October 2025, significantly exceeding the approved outlay of INR 63.22 billion. Specialty steel output under the scheme stood at 2.34mt, indicating gradual progress towards higher-value production.

The survey positions steel as a core enabler of India’s investment cycle. Construction accounted for 7.8% of GDP in FY26, while gross fixed capital formation stood at 30% of GDP, reinforcing steel’s reliance on domestic capital expenditure rather than export demand.

Overall, the survey points to a steady but more contested outlook. Domestic demand and policy continuity provide support, but international price volatility and input security risks are set to shape margins and trade flows through 2025-26.`,

        title: "Expansion of CBAM will increase revenues from the mechanism by 23%",
        date: "30/01/2026",
        content: `The EC also defends temporary deviation from conditions for fertilizers
The expansion of the European Cross-Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to increase revenues from it by 23%, potentially bringing in an additional €500 million by 2030. This was reported by EUobserver.

This step also includes taking scrap into account for consumption.

Speaking at a meeting of the European Parliament’s Environment Committee on January 27, European Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra recalled that CBAM had been extended to approximately 180 product types, mostly goods containing steel and aluminum. This move is intended to prevent companies from avoiding carbon taxes by carrying out the most polluting production operations outside the EU and then sending the finished products back to the bloc.

Hookstra also clarified that the expansion would be “narrowly targeted” and would only apply to products where there is a high risk of circumvention, rather than complex industrial goods such as cars.

Some MEPs criticized the CBAM simplification package at the meeting. However, the European Commissioner for Climate Action pointed out that 99% of emissions are still covered by the mechanism, adding that it is extremely important to reduce the administrative burden without weakening the impact on the climate.

He added that the new threshold would be subject to annual assessment based on updated trade flows and emissions data, as well as a review clause that would allow the EC to adjust the system if it did not work.

The European Commission will also introduce stricter rules to combat carbon tax evasion, including the use of default values for countries if importers do not provide reliable emissions data.

In addition, Huxtra defended the temporary exemption from CBAM requirements for fertilizers, citing pressure on farmers and the risk of price increases. According to him, the European fertilizer industry is operating at 30% below capacity and is generally more environmentally friendly than imports, a significant portion of which still come from Russia.

The European Commissioner added that if a choice has to be made, it is better to help European farmers.

It should be recalled that in January this year, the European Commission proposed a provision on the temporary suspension of the cross-border carbon adjustment mechanism for goods in serious and unforeseen circumstances – a new Article 27a in the relevant regulation.`,

In 2025, Austrian steel companies increased steel production by 5.9% compared to 2024, to 620 thousand tons. The country ranks 20th in the WorldSteel global ranking of steel producers.

In December, steel production by Austrian steelmakers increased by 10.9% compared to December 2024, reaching 620,000 tons. Compared to the previous month, the figure rose by 2.3%.

Recently, the country’s main steel producer, Voestalpine AG, announced the possibility of reducing production capacity at two of its plants in the country: Voestalpine Tubulars in Kindberg and BÖHLER Bleche in Mürzzuschlag. The reason for the adjustments is pressure from US tariffs and insufficient demand for steel.

The company had previously highlighted problems with production costs and competitiveness. The manufacturer appealed to the authorities to renew the mechanism for compensating energy-intensive enterprises for the cost of electricity.

Overall, EU steel companies increased steel production by 3.9% y/y – to 9.9 million tons in December 2025, while reducing it by 0.9% y/y – to 42.8 million tons for the year.

As reported by GMK Center, Austria produced 7.1 million tons of steel in 2024, which is in line with the 2023 level. The country ranked 23rd in the global ranking of steel-producing countries, while in 2022 it ranked 22nd.

Austria is home to two Voestalpine steel plants: Voestalpine Stahl Linz with a capacity of 6 million tons of steel per year and Voestalpine Stahl Donawitz with a capacity of 1.57 million tons per year.`,

        content: `In Q4, the EU and eurozone economies grew by 0.3% q/q, maintaining a moderate recovery trajectory
In 2025, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the European Union grew by 1.6% year-on-year, while the eurozone economy added 1.5%. This is evidenced by Eurostat’s preliminary estimate.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, GDP increased by 1.4% year-on-year in the EU and by 1.3% year-on-year in the eurozone, indicating a gradual but modest recovery in economic activity at the end of the year. On a quarterly basis, seasonally adjusted GDP grew by 0.3% q/q in both the European Union and the eurozone. Thus, growth rates in the eurozone remained at the previous quarter’s level, while in the EU they slowed slightly from 0.4% in the third quarter to 0.3%.

Among the member states, the highest quarterly growth was recorded in Lithuania (+1.7%). Spain and Portugal showed the same dynamics at +0.8% q/q. At the same time, Ireland was the only country where GDP declined on a quarterly basis, by 0.6%. In annual terms, 14 countries showed positive economic dynamics, while in one country the indicator remained unchanged.

The dynamics of the bloc’s largest economies remained uneven. In Q4, Germany’s GDP grew by 0.3% q/q, France’s by 0.2% q/q, and Italy’s also by 0.3% q/q, while Spain showed a stronger recovery of +0.8% q/q. In annual terms, growth in these countries ranged from 0.4% in Germany to 2.6% in Spain, highlighting the varying speeds of recovery among the EU’s leading economies.

According to Eurostat estimates, the EU’s GDP grew by 1% in 2024 compared to 2023. In the eurozone, this figure increased by 0.9% y/y.

In the fourth quarter, seasonally adjusted EU GDP grew by 0.4% compared to the previous quarter and by 1.4% compared to the same period in 2023. In the eurozone, the indicator grew by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter and by 1.2% year-on-year.`,

        content: `The country notes that its steel industry does not contribute to the global excess capacity
Switzerland insists on exemption from the EU’s planned new protective measures on steel imports and has convened a special meeting with representatives of the bloc on trade issues. This is stated in a report by the country’s government.

A meeting of delegates from both sides to discuss trade barriers took place in Brussels on January 29.

According to the Swiss government, steel production in the country does not contribute to global overcapacity. Instead, it supports the functioning of regional supply chains that are crucial to European industrial ecosystems.

“Switzerland is continuing its efforts to find a solution with the EU that will preserve trade as much as possible,” the statement said.

In addition to steel, Switzerland will focus on exemption from EU protective measures restricting imports of certain manganese and silicon-based alloys (ferroalloys). The country also expressed concern about the possibility of the EU imposing restrictions on the export of aluminum scrap.

As a reminder, in October 2025, the European Commission presented a proposal to protect the EU steel industry from the unfair impact of global overcapacity. It provides for limiting duty-free imports to 18.3 million tons per year and doubling the duty rate on products outside the quota to 50% (compared to 25% under the current safeguard measure). The EC has announced its intention to work closely with the bloc’s trading partners affected by this tariff change within the WTO to offer them quotas for individual countries.

The bloc plans to make exceptions to its new safeguard measures only for countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) – Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.`,

        content: `Ukraine’s energy system, designed during the Soviet era with enormous reserves to power industrial giants, has suffered critical damage. During the spring and summer shelling campaign of 2024, Ukraine lost more than 9 GW of generating capacity. For comparison, this is equivalent to the total consumption of several European countries. More than 50% of the country’s total generation capacity was destroyed or occupied, including Europe’s largest Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (6 GW) and a number of key thermal power plants (Trypilska, Zmiivska).

Despite the heroic efforts of energy workers to restore power, the winter of 2025–2026 became the most difficult test. The January 2026 attacks on transmission substations and generation facilities led to the introduction of strict consumption limits, which in some industrial regions (Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions) reached the level of emergency blackouts.

The National Bank predicts that the electricity deficit will continue until the end of 2026. This means that energy restrictions are becoming the “new normal,” which will hold GDP growth at -0.5% in 2026 due to this factor alone.`,

However, some Turkish mills that enquired about scrap continued to resist higher levels.

Amid a strong euro, most Benelux exporters lowered their purchase prices in the second half of the week from €275/t levels earlier. By Friday, Benelux dock prices were reported at around €270/t, with €272/t heard as the highest and only price from a limited number of exporters. Despite the euro easing from its recent peak near $1.20 to $1.192 on Friday, exporters failed to see any relief, as they continued to face buyer resistance and thin scrap inflows.

A Benelux supplier tells Kallanish: “It has been a very confusing week due to the sharp appreciation of the euro. We struggled to set dock and offer prices and ended up closely watching exchange rate movements rather than doing business.”

US suppliers sought prices at above $380/t cfr, though no deals were confirmed at these levels before the weekend. A UK-origin supplier is heard seeking $373/t cfr for HMS 1&2 80:20, while some Benelux suppliers expressed price targets at above $375/t cfr.

Meanwhile, an Egyptian mill opened a tender for the purchase of scrap on Friday.

Facing higher scrap costs, some Turkish mills tried to hike prices by extending payment terms on Friday. However, levels of $540-545/t ex-works were still available in the south, while prices stood at $547-570/t ex-works, depending on the region and payment terms, in other regions.

        date: "02/02/2026",
        content: `At the beginning of 2026, carbon prices in the EU ETS rose sharply. The main factors behind the growth, which began in December last year, are the gradual reduction in the supply of allowances as part of the reform of the emissions trading system, speculative behavior by players, and the final implementation of the cross-border carbon adjustment mechanism (CBAM). The link between carbon prices and gas prices has weakened.

At the end of 2025, investment funds confidently shifted from net short to net long positions in EUA futures. According to the Financial Times, hedge funds and other speculative investors are increasing their investments in EU carbon markets amid a looming shortage, which is pushing up prices and increasing costs for some heavy industry companies in the bloc. According to the Intercontinental Exchange, the publication notes, investment funds have sharply increased their net bets on the rise in the cost of carbon emission allowances since August last year, reaching their highest level since records began in 2018 in January 2026.

The European carbon market is actively responding to changes in the geopolitical situation. On January 20, EUA futures (December 2026 contract) fell to €84.9/t due to pressure from sellers linked to Donald Trump’s threats of new tariffs for certain EU countries and the UK. On January 29, the price of carbon allowances hit a seven-week low amid traders liquidating long positions and energy markets rising due to the United States’ toughening rhetoric on Iran.

At the end of last year, carbon market analysts expected European carbon prices to rise in 2026. In mid-December, Montel experts predicted that the average EUA price would be €92.02/t, which is about 24% higher than in 2025. ING expects the average price of emission allowances in the EU to reach €83/t this year, compared to an average of nearly €75/t in 2025.

Climate Market Now believes that in Q1, the market will aim to reach a historic high for the benchmark contract of €101.25/t. BBVA’s baseline scenario for 2026 assumes that carbon allowances will trade in the range of €80-100/t.

According to GMK Center’s forecast, by 2030, the average price for CO₂ emissions in the European emissions trading system could reach €126/t. This figure is the consensus among estimates from leading analytical institutions, including BloombergNEF, ABN Amro, Refinitiv, ICIS, S&P Global, Aurora Energy Research, and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.`,

        content: `In 2025, Ukraine increased its supplies of finished steel products to the European Union. Exports of rolled steel products (flat and long products and pipes) grew by 24.6% y/y – to 2.65 million tons. The main contribution was made by the flat products segment, whose shipments increased by 16.9% y/y – to 1.60 million tons, as well as long products (+63.3% y/y – to 770,000 tons). At the same time, pipe exports remained almost at the previous year’s level, decreasing by 2.3% y/y – to 279 thousand tons.

Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania remain the largest markets for rolled steel products. In particular, flat rolled steel shipments to Poland increased by 19.3% y/y – to 744,000 tons, and to Bulgaria by 17.7% y/y – to 461,000 tons. In the long products segment, exports to Poland increased by 57.3% y/y – to 336 thousand tons, and to Romania by 93.6% y/y – to 233 thousand tons. Pipe supplies to Poland increased by 23.4% y/y – to 106 thousand tons, while exports to Germany decreased by 20.3% y/y – to 40 thousand tons.

At the same time, the raw materials group showed a sharp decline. Total exports of iron ore, semi-finished products, pig iron, ferroalloys, and scrap to the EU in 2025 decreased by 17% y/y – to 15.17 million tons. The key factor was a 21% y/y decrease in iron ore supplies to 13.11 million tons, as well as an 8.4% y/y decline in semi-finished products exports to 987,000 tons.

The largest decline in ore exports was recorded in exports to Poland (-18.1% y/y, to 4.17 million tons) and Slovakia (-11.4% y/y, to 4.40 million tons). In the semi-finished products segment, the decline in Bulgaria reached 22.5% y/y (to 461 thousand tons), while deliveries to Poland, on the contrary, increased by 126.9% y/y – to 291 thousand tons, but this was not enough to compensate for the overall decline.

Amid a reduction in key raw material flows, shipments of pig iron (+131.7% y/y, to 568 thousand tons), ferroalloys (+12% y/y, to 54 thousand tons), and scrap (+53.1% y/y, to 448 thousand tons) increased. In particular, exports of pig iron to Italy increased 4.5 times to 416 thousand tons, scrap to Poland – by 38.2% y/y to 344 thousand tons, and to Greece – by 41.7% y/y – to 48 thousand tons. At the same time, due to relatively small absolute volumes, these segments were unable to compensate for losses in iron ore.

Overall, exports of iron and steel products from Ukraine to the EU in 2025 decreased by 12.7% y/y – to 17.81 million tons. Poland and Slovakia remain key markets, but even here there has been a decline: deliveries to Poland decreased by 6.1% y/y – to 6.08 million tons, and to Slovakia by 11.2% y/y – to 4.44 million tons.

The current dynamics show that Ukraine is not and cannot become a factor of pressure on the European steel market. Even with the growth in rolled steel exports, total supplies to the EU are declining, and the possibilities for further growth are limited by internal problems in the industry. These include unstable operations of enterprises, shortages, and high costs of electricity, regular production stoppages due to power outages, and complex logistics in wartime conditions.

These factors are systemic in nature and constrain both raw material extraction and finished product output. In the absence of a stable energy supply and security guarantees, there are no prospects for significant growth in Ukrainian steel exports to the EU in the medium term. Ukraine remains a forced limited supplier rather than a competitive threat to European manufacturers.

In 2025, Ukrainian scrap metal exporters increased exports of strategic raw materials by 53% compared to 2024, to 448.68 thousand tons. This figure is a four-year peak, i.e., the maximum since 2021. This is evidenced by GMK Center calculations based on data from the State Customs Service.

Poland remains the main export destination. Over 12 months, 343.6 thousand tons of raw materials were sent to the Polish market, which is 76.6% of the total export volume and 38.2% more than in 2024. Another 48.44 thousand tons of scrap were sent to Greece (+41.7% y/y), 16.63 thousand tons to Bulgaria (+419% y/y), and 5.29 thousand tons to Germany (-18.9% y/y).

As previously noted by Ukrmetprom, raw material supplies to EU countries have in fact become a scheme whereby scrap exporters avoid paying export duties of €180/ton to the Ukrainian state, as Ukrainian raw materials are re-exported through EU countries to Turkey and India.

At the end of 2025, the Ukrainian government decided to restrict scrap metal exports temporarily until the end of 2026. According to Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, scrap metal is a critically important raw material for the Ukrainian steel and foundry industries. In December, Ukrainian scrap metal companies exported 68.52 thousand tons of raw materials, which is 117% more year-on-year and 96% more month-on-month. This is the highest figure since 2021.

Revenue from scrap exports in December increased by 96.8% compared to the previous month and by 106.9% year-on-year, to $19.14 million. In 2025, the figure increased by 44.5% year-on-year, to $131.93 million.

In 2023, shipments of raw materials abroad exceeded 182.5 thousand tons, which is 3.4 times more y/y, while in 2022 the figure was 54.1 thousand tons. The main consumers of raw materials last year were Poland (248,600 tons), Greece (34,200 tons), and Germany (6,500 tons).

The European steel market entered 2026 with greater stability but limited momentum. This is evidenced by a January survey by Eurometal, an association representing European distributors of steel, pipes, and metal products.

According to the study, current activity remains largely unchanged compared to the last months of last year, with no further decline. At the same time, expectations for activity in the first quarter show a slight improvement compared to the end of 2025. The January results indicate that market pessimism has moderated slightly. These results reflect hopes that demand conditions may gradually normalize over the course of the year, although the outlook remains limited.

Expectations regarding inventory levels continue to signal disciplined inventory management. Most distributors expect inventory levels to remain stable overall during January-March, with no signs of aggressive replenishment. This reflects a continued aversion to risk and a preference for flexibility in a market still characterized by weak demand and uncertainty in order books.

Price expectations remain the most positive indicator in Eurometal’s January survey. As noted, after a steady improvement in the second half of 2025, price sentiment has now clearly consolidated above the neutral line. This indicates that a growing proportion of distributors are forecasting stable prices or moderate price increases in the coming months.The analysis is based on Eurometal’s market sentiment survey, which reflects the opinions of approximately 200 industry participants for January 2026.

It should be recalled that the new EU measures on steel are to include a ban on metal products from Russia and Belarus, a proposal supported by the European Parliament’s International Trade Committee (INTA). In addition, the reintroduction of unused quotas was rejected and stricter “smelting and casting” rules were approved. `,

In January-November 2025, the European Union reduced its imports of direct reduced iron (DRI) by 24.7% y-o-y – to 1.9 million tons. Despite the overall decline, the structure of imports underwent significant changes, indicating a reorientation of supply chains. This is evidenced by GMK Center calculations based on Eurostat data.

Venezuela became the main supplier of DRI to the European Union during the reporting period, exporting 594.85 thousand tons of products, doubling its supplies y-o-y. The dynamics in this direction show a steady increase in volumes: in 2023, the EU imported 133 thousand tons of Venezuelan DRI, and in 2024, 293.98 thousand tons. This significant growth confirms a change in the geography of imports against the backdrop of a reduction in supplies from traditional sources.

Russia, which was previously the main supplier of DRI to the EU, significantly reduced its exports. In January-November, Russian companies shipped 584,650 tons of products, which is 41.2% less y/y. The main importers of Russian DRI remained Italy (312.14 thousand tons, down 36% year-on-year) and Belgium (135.27 thousand tons, down 34.7% year-on-year). Poland and Spain imported 55 thousand tons (-64.3% y-o-y) and 82.2 thousand tons (-26.6% y-o-y), respectively.

Among other suppliers, the US sent 362.31 thousand tons of DRI to the EU, increasing volumes by 11.8% y/y. Libya reduced exports to 223 thousand tons (-47.3% y/y).

The resumption of supplies to these countries partially offset the sharp decline in imports from Germany and the Netherlands. Germany reduced its purchases from 438.45 thousand tons in January-November 2024 to 28.12 thousand tons in 2025, and the Netherlands – from 392.4 thousand tons to 145.03 thousand tons.

In November, the EU imported 181.42 thousand tons of DRI, which is 32.7% less y/y and 2.1% more m/m. Venezuela supplied 32.72 thousand tons (+20.7% y-o-y; -20.7% m-o-m) during the month, while the US supplied 29.37 thousand tons (-44% y-o-y; -17% m-o-m).

In December, imports fell by 18.6% y/y in physical terms (1.5 million tons) and by 16.6% y/y in monetary terms ($1 billion), but this did not change the overall upward trend for the year.

Russia and China remained the key sources of supply. Imports from Russia increased by 37.9% y/y – to 4.5 million tons, and from China by 13.3% – to 4.2 million tons. The strengthening of these countries’ presence, along with state subsidies and dumping prices, was one of the factors contributing to the expansion of Turkey’s trade deficit, which increased by 11.9% y/y in 2025 – to $92.9 billion.

Against this backdrop, the ratio of exports to imports in the steel sector improved from 73.9% in 2024 to 77.6% in 2025, but the industry continues to face fierce competition in global markets. Additional pressure on foreign sales is created by EU regulatory initiatives, in particular the tightening of quotas and the introduction of CBAM, which is gradually changing the conditions of access to the European market and forcing Turkish exporters to adapt to new requirements for carbon footprint and product traceability.

Domestic consumption of rolled metal products reached 3.4 million tons in December, up 3.8% from December 2024. For 2025, the figure rose by 2.6% y/y – to 39.3 million tons.

        content: `The country is focusing on developing its mining industry
Algeria has opened the 950-kilometer western mining railway Gara Djebilet-Tindouf-Béchar, Gulf Industry reports.

The new line crosses a large desert area and forms a key logistics corridor for Algeria’s mining sector. It allows iron ore to be transported from the Gara Djebilet mine through the city of Bechar to northern ports and industrial facilities, including the Tosyali Holding steel complex near Oran.

As Bloomberg notes, the railway line was built in cooperation with China and is key to developing iron ore deposits in order to diversify the economy.

This move gives the green light for the first shipments of ore from the Gara Djebilet mine near the Moroccan border, an initiative that has been under discussion for decades. Among the companies involved in the broader project are Feraal, a subsidiary of the Algerian state mining company Sonarem, and China’s Sinosteel.

Algeria is focusing on developing its mining industry. More than three-quarters of the country’s exports and about half of its government revenues typically come from hydrocarbons, making the country vulnerable to volatile energy prices and forcing it to look for other avenues.

Earlier, it was reported that Algeria plans to commission a mining and processing plant for iron ore from the Gara Djebilet deposit (Tindouf province) by the end of April 2026. The enterprise, managed by Sonarem, a national mining industrial group, will process up to 4 million tons of ore per year. Sonarem CEO Belkacem Soltani reported that several large international companies from the US, India, and China have shown significant interest in investing and cooperating in Algeria’s mining sector, particularly in Gara Djebilet.`,

During the Joint Committee meeting, Switzerland argued that the planned EU measures should disrupt bilateral trade as little as possible and ensure the proper functioning of the Switzerland-EU free trade agreement.

The European Commission (EC) indicated that it intends to reassess the situation regarding safeguard measures on ferroalloys during the first year of application. The EC imposed country-specific tariff-rate quotas for each ferroalloy type in November last year, as SteelOrbis previously reported. With the exception of certain developing countries and Ukraine, the safeguards apply to all exporting countries, including Switzerland as well as members of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area.

At the extraordinary meeting, Switzerland again called for Swiss steel products to be excluded from the scope of the new measures. The Swiss authorities stressed that Swiss steel production does not contribute to global overcapacity, but instead supports regional value chains that are important for certain European industrial ecosystems.

Switzerland said it will continue efforts to find a solution with the EU that preserves bilateral trade flows to the greatest extent possible.`,

In December, Turkey’s billet and slab production amounted to 2.23 million mt and 1.29 million mt, up 16.5 percent and 22.1 percent year on year, respectively. In 2025, Turkey produced 24.2 million mt of billet, up 6.1 percent, against 13.91 million mt of slab, down 1.2 percent, both compared to 2024.

In the given month, finished steel consumption in Turkey rose by 3.8 percent year on year to 3.4 million mt, while in 2025 the country’s finished steel consumption increased by 2.6 percent year on year to 39.3 million mt.

In 2025, Turkey’s steel export to import ratio increased to 77.63 percent, from 73.91 percent recorded in 2024.

According to the TCUD, 2025 was recorded as an extremely challenging period for the Turkish steel industry. Rising financing costs, together with global price pressure stemming from dumped and subsidized products, particularly from Russia, China and other Far Eastern countries, placed a heavy burden on producers’ costs. The intensifying export pressure in Russia, China and Far Eastern countries caused Turkey’s steel imports to reach 18.9 million mt, the highest level in history. The increase in imports of dumped and subsidized steel products also contributed to Turkey’s foreign trade deficit rising by 11.9 percent to $92.9 billion in 2025.Although Turkey’s steel production capacity increased to 61.9 million mt in 2025, the sector’s capacity utilization rate declined from 74.8 percent to 61.6 percent.

Meanwhile, the TCUD stated that the EU’s efforts to tighten quotas and restrict Turkey’s steel exports have increased pressure on the country’s steel exports. In addition, with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism entering into force, 2026 will mark a period in which competition will increasingly be shaped by a sustainability approach covering the entire product life-cycle.`,

        content: `Due to shelling of ports and restrictions on imports from Turkey, there is a shortage of 30–50 mm thick sheet steel on the market
The Ukrainian steel products market ended last year with cautious optimism, but the beginning of 2026 brought new challenges. The energy crisis, logistical problems due to shelling of ports, and an increasing labor shortage created difficult conditions for business.

Steel products sales dynamics
Last year, our company recorded a 20% increase in sales. The largest growth was in the segment of I-beams, sheet steel, and 355 steel profile pipes. The smallest increase was recorded in the angle bar segment.

However, I do not believe that this indicates overall market growth. Rather, it is the result of our company’s development: we have significantly increased our warehouse stocks, increased the number of managers, and intensified our sales and advertising policies. Competition in the market has increased—it has become tighter.

Throughout the year, we saw the usual seasonal patterns for construction: the beginning of the year was the worst period, the middle of the year was the best, and there was a slight decline in November and December. Last year’s construction season started a little late. It usually begins in late March or early April, but sales picked up somewhere in the second half of May.

Demand structure
The main demand is generated by private clients (commercial construction). Last year, logistics centers, warehouses, elevators, and sugar factories were actively built – all of them by private customers. Among our main clients are steel construction plants that work on private construction in western Ukraine.

As for government orders, I did not see any activity on the part of the state during the year. Only at the end of the year, in December, did something happen in the area of government procurement for the protection of energy facilities, when the story of possible blackouts began.

As for the regions, more than half of our sales are in central and left-bank Ukraine. I see growing activity in western Ukraine—the number of inquiries and orders is increasing.

Price dynamics
Over the past year, prices remained virtually unchanged. In the second half of the year, they rose slightly by 3–4%. Overall, there has been no significant price growth on the Ukrainian market.

At the end of the year, prices began to rise slightly due to an increase in currency exchange rates—the euro and dollar rose significantly. This affected the price of imported steel, but price competition is very fierce. Part of the exchange rate differences are simply “eaten up” by dealer margins, as there is no possibility of raising prices. Today, the market is as nationwide as possible – the net margin rarely exceeds 5%.

Impact of the energy crisis
The beginning of 2026 is not very active due to blackouts. Many customers have halted construction due to the lack of power supply. Metalworking plants are operating at half capacity at best, as there is no stable power supply. Everyone is working on generators. Some are unable to work at full capacity, so they have slowed down their work. This is noticeable in January.

Personnel crisis
The shortage of personnel continues to worsen. If last year the situation was catastrophic, now it is deteriorating before our very eyes. This leads to higher wages, and in a competitive environment, wage growth comes at the expense of margins.

Logistical problems
Much of the steel is imported from Turkey by barge. From the end of December and throughout January (after the Russians shelled the port of Odessa), there were problems with barges entering the port. As a result, there is now a local shortage of certain types of rolled steel. In the 30, 40, and 50 mm thick sheet segment, there is simply nothing on the market.

According to our colleagues in the market, there are currently many barges loaded with steel standing in Romanian territorial waters, waiting for the opportunity to unload at the port of Odessa. Many Turkish shipowners who used to deliver steel products to Ukraine have refused to enter Ukrainian ports. Only Ukrainian barges remain, of which there are few, and some of them have not yet been unloaded.

There are issues with unloading capabilities. First, the port of Odessa has been shelled, and second, it has been operating exclusively on generators for a long time and continues to do so. Its cargo handling capabilities are very limited. There was a period when ships did not enter the port at all due to the clearing of debris.`,

In January-November 2025, the European Union imported 4.55 million tons (-9.8% y/y) of steel raw materials of Russian origin. The cost of imports reached €1.85 billion (-22.4% y/y). This is evidenced by GMK Center calculations based on Eurostat data.

The bulk of imports consists of semi-finished products. In the first 11 months of 2025, 3.19 million tons of semi-finished products (+9.9% y-o-y) were shipped to the EU. Import costs amounted to €1.4 billion (-5% y/y). The largest consumers of semi-finished products from Russia are Belgium – 1.16 million tons (+1.2% y/y), Italy – 718,070 tons (+7.7% y/y), the Czech Republic – 711.4 thousand tons (+62.5% y/y), and Denmark – 498.35 thousand tons (+7.6% y/y).

Large volumes of imports are accounted for by cast iron – 696.99 thousand tons (-32.2% y/y). The revenue of Russian iron and steel companies from supplying products to the EU market amounted to €254.45 million (-39.5% y/y). The main volumes were sent to Italy – 524.62 thousand tons (-31.8% y/y), Latvia – 87.27 thousand tons (-40.9% y/y), and Belgium – 31.07 thousand tons (+1.5% y/y).

There were almost no deliveries of Russian-made ferroalloys to the EU market in January-November 2025 – 26.5 tons compared to 59.83 thousand tons a year earlier.

Scrap imports from Russia amounted to 69.18 thousand tons (+62.3% y/y), and procurement costs amounted to €21.25 million (-9.9% y/y). Iron ore supplies amounted to 2.04 thousand tons (9.36 thousand tons in January-November 2024). Imports of direct reduced iron (DRI) during this period amounted to 584.65 thousand tons (-41.2% y/y) for €175.83 million (-47.2% y/y).

In November 2025, the EU imported 352.85 thousand tons (+2.2% y/y; -38% m/m) of iron and steel products from Russia, including:

pig iron – 0 thousand tons (0 thousand tons in November 2024; 0 thousand tons in October);
semi-finished products – 294.13 thousand tons (+27.4% y/y; -42.1% m/m);
DRI – 58.7 thousand tons (-44.1% y/y; +14.5% m/m);
scrap – 0 thousand tons (5.41 thousand tons in November 2024; 10.2 thousand tons in October);
raw materials – 0 thousand tons (0 thousand tons in November 2024; 0 thousand tons in October).
Revenue from exports to the EU in November amounted to €138.86 million, which is 9.2% less y/y and 37.3% less m/m.As a reminder, the EU imported 5.34 million tons of iron and steel products from Russia in 2024.

Despite sanctions, Russian producers continue to receive significant revenues from exports to the European Union, which exceeded €2.5 billion last year. This indicates the weak effectiveness of the current restrictions and the existence of exceptions that allow Russian steel companies to export to EU markets. `,

        content: `Industry organizations appealed to the EU ambassador to Ukraine to soften the process of implementing the mechanism
Trade unions have expressed concern about the extremely negative impact of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on the country’s economy. This is stated in a statement released by the Trade Union of Metallurgists and Miners of Ukraine (PMGU).According to the forecast of the National Mining Association of Ukraine, the losses to the national economy in the first year of full implementation of the CBAM could reach more than $200 million. The Federation of Steelmakers points to the prospect of a total decline in the domestic iron and steel complex. The trade union emphasizes the threat of job losses and increased tension in the frontline regions, including cities that are strategic for holding the front line.

The statement cites examples of the first consequences of CBAM for the country. For example, ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih recently announced a forced shutdown of the rolling mill department in the second quarter.

As noted by Natalia Marynyuk, chair of the primary organization of the PMGU enterprise, the key factor behind this step was the European Commission’s decision to introduce CBAM from January 1, 2026, without considering the objective economic and market conditions in which Ukrainian producers operate during the war.

The introduction of the mechanism during the period of martial law in Ukraine poses serious threats to the Ukrainian steel industry, which is export-oriented and has high carbon intensity – loss of competitiveness due to additional costs for CBAM certificates and an increase in production costs, potential reduction in exports, shutdown of capacities, job losses, and for the state – a decline in GDP and taxes.

For ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, the additional costs of accessing the EU market will amount to $60-90/t, which will make its products uncompetitive compared to European or less carbon-intensive producers. As a result, the company’s European customers have already suspended all orders, leading to a loss of 1.25 million tons of exports planned for 2026.

The European Commission did not consider the arguments of the Ukrainian government regarding the application of Article 30. 7 of CBAM Regulation (EU) 2023/956, which provides for the possibility of postponing or adjusting the application of the mechanism for countries affected by unforeseeable, exceptional, and unprovoked events that cause serious damage to economic and industrial infrastructure.

If the EC does not decide on a preferential or transitional period for Ukrainian producers, then, in particular, for ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, in addition to the shutdown of the blooming shop, this could lead to the shutdown of the blast furnace and part of the finishing production facilities, the loss of jobs, and the layoff of part of the staff.

The PMGU has proposed appealing to the European side to soften the process of implementing CBAM for Ukraine. Measures could include extending the transition period, introducing specific instruments to support Ukrainian producers, creating special funds for financial assistance and re-equipping production facilities, as well as involving trade union representatives in the dialogue on the practical implementation of the mechanism.

The initiative was supported by the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine, trade unions in the coal, chemical, energy, construction materials, and agro-industrial sectors. A letter to this effect was sent to EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Maternova.

Earlier, Mauro Longobardo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, noted that without a transition period for CBAM, Ukraine would lose the core of its steel industry. `,

On February 2, US President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with India that reduces US tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% in exchange for India stopping purchases of Russian oil and reducing trade barriers, Reuters reports.

Trump announced the agreement on social media after a conversation with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He noted that India will now purchase oil from the United States and possibly Venezuela.

The basic US tariff rate on goods from India will be reduced from 25% to 18%. The White House also confirmed that the additional 25% penalty duty on this country for purchasing Russian oil will be abolished.

As Trump noted, Modi also pledged that India would “buy American at a much higher level” in addition to purchasing American energy products, including coal, as well as technological, agricultural, and other products worth more than $500 billion. The country, according to the US president’s announcement, will also reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers on American goods to zero.

Modi confirmed the new tariff rate of 18% in his post on X. However, CNBC notes that the lack of details and clear deadlines raises doubts about how quickly the framework agreement can be made binding.

Recall that in January, the US president abandoned plans to impose additional tariffs on imports from the UK and a number of EU member states due to their position on Greenland. Earlier, the European Parliament officially suspended the ratification process for a trade agreement with the United States in protest against Trump’s threats.

        content: `Among other things, India will have to stop purchasing Russian oil
On February 2, US President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with India that reduces US tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% in exchange for India stopping purchases of Russian oil and reducing trade barriers, Reuters reports.

Trump announced the agreement on social media after a conversation with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He noted that India will now purchase oil from the United States and possibly Venezuela.

The basic US tariff rate on goods from India will be reduced from 25% to 18%. The White House also confirmed that the additional 25% penalty duty on this country for purchasing Russian oil will be abolished.

As Trump noted, Modi also pledged that India would “buy American at a much higher level” in addition to purchasing American energy products, including coal, as well as technological, agricultural, and other products worth more than $500 billion. The country, according to the US president’s announcement, will also reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers on American goods to zero.

Modi confirmed the new tariff rate of 18% in his post on X. However, CNBC notes that the lack of details and clear deadlines raises doubts about how quickly the framework agreement can be made binding.

Recall that in January, the US president abandoned plans to impose additional tariffs on imports from the UK and a number of EU member states due to their position on Greenland. Earlier, the European Parliament officially suspended the ratification process for a trade agreement with the United States in protest against Trump’s threats. The EU also considered far-reaching countermeasures, including tariffs worth €93 billion in response to his statements. `,

        content: `The US president continues to use tariffs as an argument in economic and political disputes
The beginning of 2026 showed that the US is not abandoning tariffs as a tool of trade and political pressure. In January alone, Donald Trump used such threats several times, in particular against a number of European countries and Canada. Against this backdrop, the United States’ major trading partners had to come up with “defense strategies” and promote new opportunities.

“Punishment” for South Korea
On January 27, Trump announced an increase in tariffs on goods from South Korea from 15% to 25%. The new tariffs apply to automobiles, lumber, pharmaceutical products, and “all other” mutual trade items. The US president justified his decision by citing the other side’s delay in ratifying the relevant agreement concluded last year.

The US and South Korea reached an agreement at the end of July 2025 that provided for a 15% tariff on all South Korean imports. The agreement also included South Korea’s investment commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States in exchange for lower rates. The trade agreement was submitted to the South Korean National Assembly in November last year, according to local media reports, and was due to be approved in February.

South Korean officials were forced to urgently engage with their American counterparts on this issue. On January 31, Industry Minister Kim Jong-kwan said that, in his opinion, “unnecessary misunderstandings” had been resolved during talks with US Trade Representative Howard Luttick in Washington. He noted that the special bill was expected to be processed quickly and explained the reasons for the delay to the American side.

China as a provocateur
Donald Trump also continues to criticize his closest trading partners. On January 24, he threatened to impose a 100% tariff on imports from Canada if the country signed a trade agreement with China, sharply changing the position he had voiced a week earlier when he said that if an agreement with China could be reached, Carney (the Canadian prime minister) should do so.

On January 16, China and Canada reached an agreement that provides for a mutual reduction in tariffs on certain goods. China reduced tariffs on Canadian agricultural products, while Canada, in turn, will allow the import of 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles at a reduced tariff rate.

After Trump’s threats, Mark Carney said that the country does not intend to conclude a free trade agreement with China. He recalled that the USMCA (or CUSMA) provides for an obligation not to conclude such agreements with non-market economies without prior notification of others — the US and Mexico. Chinese officials, in turn, explained that the agreements reached were not directed against any third party.

However, relations with Canada continued to deteriorate. At the end of January this year, Trump announced that Washington had revoked the certification of all aircraft manufactured in Canada and threatened to impose 50% tariffs on them until Canada certified American Gulfstream business jets. However, CNN writes that it is unclear whether the US president has legal authority to do so, as the decision previously rested with aviation safety experts from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Trump also called the UK’s business dealings with China a “very dangerous” move. The comments came at the end of January, after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and made progress in securing greater access for British companies to Chinese markets.

It should be noted that the January visits of the British and Canadian prime ministers to China were the first such trips in eight years.

The Greenland issue
On January 17, the US president threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on imports from the UK, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, and to increase it to 25% from June 1 due to their position on Greenland. The next day, European talks on the matter were quickly organized. The bloc considered far-reaching countermeasures, including tariffs worth €93 billion in response to Trump’s statements. The latter step could be implemented very quickly, as it involves the reactivation of measures that the European Union suspended after reaching a trade agreement with the United States in July 2025.

However, on January 21, Trump backed down, abandoning the idea of imposing these tariffs and explaining his decision by saying that a “framework for a future agreement on Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region” had been reached after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Davos.

Earlier that day, the European Parliament officially suspended the ratification process for the trade agreement with the US in protest against the US president’s threats. However, Bernd Lange, chairman of the trade committee, noted that this would not affect the bloc’s promise to purchase $750 billion worth of energy, as the issue was not related to the tariff agreement.

At the end of January, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned the Trump administration not to question the trade agreement between the parties. According to him, the American side should be interested in ensuring that the agreements are not undermined by “daily announcements,” and the EU is not ready to agree to a deterioration of what has already been achieved.

The acceleration effect
Trump’s relentless tariff threats became a factor that accelerated Europe’s conclusion of trade agreements that had been in preparation for decades. In particular, on January 17, 2026, Brussels signed a partnership agreement and a provisional trade agreement with the South American Mercosur (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay) – negotiations had been ongoing for a quarter of a century. As noted, this step should lead to an increase in annual European exports to the countries of this economic union by approximately 39%.

On January 27, after almost two decades, the European Union and India concluded negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA) – EC President Ursula von der Leyen called it “the mother of all agreements.” It is expected to double exports of goods from the EU to India by 2032 by eliminating or reducing tariffs on 96.6% of European goods entering the Indian market. The European Union, in turn, will eliminate or reduce tariffs on 99.5% of goods imported from India over a period of seven years, according to the country’s Ministry of Trade and Industry.

However, although the lengthy negotiations have been completed, it will take time to formalize the agreements in both cases. As for Mercosur, on January 21, the European Parliament voted to challenge the agreement in the bloc’s Supreme Court, which could delay it for two years and even potentially derail it.

The US has also achieved success in negotiations with India. On February 2, Donald Trump announced that he would lower tariffs on Indian goods in exchange for a promise to stop buying Russian oil, among other things. As the US president wrote, in a conversation with him, Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to replace crude oil imports from Russia with supplies from Venezuela and the United States. He also said that the tariff on Indian goods would be reduced to 18% from 50% — a rate that included an additional 25% imposed in August last year. Trump called it a “trade deal” in a post on Truth Social.

Trump’s trade policy, which is largely based on a “carrot and stick” approach, has led to a sharp increase in US government revenues. Last year, the US collected $287 billion in customs duties, tariffs, and taxes, almost three times more than in 2024. Approximately one-third of this amount was collected in the fourth quarter alone. However, The New York Times notes that most economists believe that a significant portion of the tariff burden is borne by US businesses and consumers.

In the last months of the year, the Trump administration also managed to reduce the trade deficit, which was one of its stated “tariff” goals. At the same time, jobs continued to decline last year in the manufacturing sector, which should have benefited from import duties, and industrial production in the country grew by only 1% year-on-year at the end of last year.

At the same time, according to ODI Global’s analysis, the US tariff regime, combined with reduced development aid from the US and the EU, poses a threat to the global economy, exposing low- and middle-income countries to the risk of economic instability, primarily due to a decline in export revenues. Large economies are seeking new partnerships to reduce their dependence on the United States.`,

        date: "04/02/2026",
        content: `The country's prime minister also called for the postponement of the launch of ETS 2
The European Union should review its carbon trading schemes to lower energy prices. This was called for by Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš in a letter to EU institutions and leaders of the other 26 countries in the bloc, published on February 2. This was reported by Reuters.

Babiš believes that the EU should limit the cost of emission allowances under its ETS and postpone the implementation of its second phase.

At a press conference, the Czech Prime Minister said he would lobby for support on this issue among other EU leaders, including France and Italy, ahead of the bloc’s informal summit on February 12. According to him, prices for allowances in previous years were forecast to be much lower than the current level, which puts a heavy burden on European industry.

In addition, according to Czech Radio, Babiš stressed the need for a single pan-European goal — reducing carbon emissions. However, in his opinion, setting additional partial goals limits the ability of member states to make their own decisions in the energy sector and may be less effective and more financially demanding than individual approaches.

The official also called for postponing the introduction of the emissions trading system for buildings and transport, known as ETS2, until at least 2030. The bloc had previously agreed to postpone its launch from 2027 to 2028.

Some countries, including Poland, have long argued that carbon prices in the EU are too high and have called on Brussels to intervene to curb the rise, which they believe is driven by financial speculation rather than genuine demand from greenhouse gas-emitting industries. Other EU countries consider high prices important for achieving climate goals, as they encourage investment in low-carbon technologies and the transition to cleaner fuels.

At the end of last year, carbon market analysts expected European carbon prices to rise in 2026. Montel experts predicted that the average EUA price would be €92.02/t, which is about 24% higher than in 2025. ING expects the average price of emission allowances in the EU to reach €83/t this year, compared to an average of almost €75/t in 2025.

Climate Market Now believes that in Q1, the market will aim to reach a historic high for the benchmark contract of €101.25/t. BBVA’s baseline scenario for 2026 assumes that carbon allowances will trade in the range of €80-100/t.

According to GMK Center’s forecast, by 2030, the average price for CO₂ emissions in the European emissions trading system could reach €126/t. This figure is the consensus among estimates from leading analytical institutions, including BloombergNEF, ABN Amro, Refinitiv, ICIS, S&P Global, Aurora Energy Research, and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.`,

Brazilian steel company Gerdau has restarted its steel billet plant in Ceará, Brazil, according to Argus Media.

The plant was shut down for renovation in May 2024. The company invested R$200 million ($38 million) in it to improve efficiency and reduce its environmental impact.

The resumption of operations at this plant is part of Gerdau’s strategy to strengthen its position as a supplier of metal products in the north and northeast of the country. Local buyers are heavily dependent on imports, as trade with Brazilian plants is hampered by high domestic logistics costs.

Gerdau uses local mini-mills as a strategy to reduce logistics costs and increase the attractiveness of its products in the domestic market.

The plant in Ceará will focus on producing 12-meter-long billets. The company will roll them itself rather than selling them to third parties. The company’s semi-finished products will also be supplied to Gerdau’s mini-mill in Caucaia.

It should be recalled that in September last year, Gerdau warned that without decisive measures to support the metallurgical industry, Brazil risks losing its domestic steel production, which could have a negative impact on the entire industrial supply chain. The share of imported steel in the domestic market is now 22-25%, whereas previously it was 10%. Most of these imports come from China. In addition, the Brazilian steel industry was operating at 35% of its capacity.

        content: `New EU quotas and agreement with India will increase pressure on Turkish exports
Turkish steel producers expect steel production and consumption in the country to grow by about 7% in 2026, exceeding 40 million tons. This was stated by Veysel Yayin, secretary general of the Turkish Steel Producers Association (TCUD), commenting on the annual results of the steel industry, Anadolu Ajansı reports.

According to him, last year was an extremely difficult period for the Turkish steel industry. Rising financing costs, as well as dumping and subsidized global price pressure, especially from Far Eastern countries such as Russia and China, put a strain on producers’ costs.

However, despite a decline in production in the first half of the year, Turkey’s steel sector managed to increase its output in the fourth quarter. Steel consumption in the country, which also declined in the first half of 2025, rose to 39.3 million tons by the end of the year, reaching a historic high.

Yayan said that the EU’s efforts to tighten quotas, as well as the free trade agreement signed with India, the world’s second-largest steel producer, are increasing pressure on Turkish exports.

The TCUD secretary general also highlighted the importance of the European Cross-Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) coming into force.

Yayan added that under such conditions, it is extremely important for the Turkish steel sector to strengthen its sustainability performance not only in terms of production, but also in terms of its methods and products.

According to TCUD data, steel exports from Turkey grew by 12.5% year-on-year – to 15.1 million tons last year. Imports of steel products also grew last year, by 8.6% year-on-year, to a record 18.9 million tons. Russia and China remained the main sources of supply.

In January 2026, Australia increased its exports of iron ore and pellets by 19.8% year-on-year to 76.6 million tons. This is evidenced by data on ship composition collected by BigMint.

At the same time, compared to December 2025, this figure decreased by 11.4%.

China remained the main importer, accounting for 64.6 million tons of Australia’s total mineral exports for the period, followed by South Korea (4.6 million tons) and Japan (4.1 million tons).

Rio Tinto exported 25.9 million tons of iron ore in January this year, BHP – 24.1 million tons, and Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) – 18.7 million tons.

The decline in Australian mineral exports compared to December 2025 was due to low global demand during the New Year holidays. At the same time, increased stocks in China limited active booking. In addition, global mining companies are increasing production to meet their forecasts.

Overall, according to BigMint, exports of iron ore from key global producers — Australia, Brazil, South Africa, and India — declined in January compared to the previous month. This was facilitated by the accumulation of significant iron ore stocks in Chinese ports, and thus a decrease in the urgency of aggressive purchases by major global buyers.

It should be recalled that BHP is looking for alternative buyers for its ore amid a contract dispute with China. In December and January, the company shipped Jimblebar ore to Malaysia and Vietnam. Although these shipments are small compared to BHP’s annual production, the unusual deals demonstrate the Australian group’s efforts to diversify its buyers. The company previously stated that it is still negotiating the terms of an annual contract with China Mineral Resources Group and optimizing its sales channels.`,

        content: `The India-US trade deal announced on 2 February has improved sentiment across India’s industrial value chain. For steel, however, the impact remains indirect and downstream focused, Kallanish understands.

US Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminium and copper remain at 50%, while selected auto components continue to face duties of 25%, keeping Indian direct steel exports to the US constrained.

Market participants broadly view the agreement as neutral for steel trade. A steel sector expert notes that Indian steel exports to the US were already minimal last year due to tariffs, and volumes were subdued even before recent increases. In this context, any easing of tariffs would be unlikely to materially revive exports, with “no major change” expected unless Section 232 terms are explicitly addressed.

Policy clarity also remains limited. An industry veteran cautions that details so far are confined to political statements and social media posts, and prefers to await formal documentation before reassessing the deal’s implications.

The immediate relevance for steel lies in downstream manufacturing. The reduction in reciprocal US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% materially improves the competitiveness of several export-oriented, steel-intensive sectors. Their expansion is expected to lift domestic steel consumption rather than generate direct export flows.

Engineering and capital goods represent the strongest transmission mechanism. Machinery and equipment account for 8.1% of India’s exports to the US and are identified as immediate beneficiaries, as per equity research firm SAMCO Securities’ latest note.

Lower tariffs could reduce the landed cost of Indian-made boilers, industrial machinery and nuclear equipment, which are intensive users of hot rolled coil and specialised plate. Higher order inflows in these segments typically translate into higher steel offtake.

Auto ancillaries offer a steadier but narrower upside. Export-oriented forgers benefit from improved pricing headroom, although Section 232 duties on specific components cap volume acceleration. The implication for steel demand is incremental, supporting alloy and forging-grade consumption.

Electronics manufacturing also gains at the margin. Electrical machinery is already India’s largest export category to the US by value. Tariff relief and the removal of punitive penalties support domestic production of electronic housings and solar components, reinforcing demand for galvanised and coated flat steel.

Currency movement provides an additional layer of support. The rupee strengthened by around 1.5% versus the dollar following the announcement. Brokerage firm Elara Securities expects the currency pair to trend towards INR 88.5-89/dollar in the coming weeks as external trade risks ease.

For steelmakers, rupee appreciation lowers the landed cost of imported metallurgical coal. Given India’s structural dependence on coking coal imports, this improves margin visibility, particularly if global steel prices remain rangebound.

India’s stated intent to increase purchases of US coal and energy could further stabilise sourcing, although this is viewed as a “long-term aspiration” rather than a firm commitment, says think-tank GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava.`,
