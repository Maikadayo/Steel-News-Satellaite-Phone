        date: "29/01/2026",
        content: `Morocco has formally notified the World Trade Organization (TWO) about the initiation of a safeguard review on possible extension of the safeguard measure on hot-rolled steel sheet, Kallanish notes.

The investigation covers hot-rolled steel sheet, whether in coils or not, classified under Moroccan customs tariff codes 7208, 721113, 721114, 721119, 722530, 722540, 7226200011, 7226200020, 7226200051, 7226200052, 7226200059, 722691 and 7226998000. 

The review investigation was opened on 22 January by Morocco’s Ministry of Industry and Commerce, following a request from Maghreb Steel, which represents the domestic producing industry.

According to the notification, the review was launched on the grounds that the safeguard measure remains necessary to remedy and prevent serious injury, and that the domestic industry is still completing adjustment efforts to improve competitiveness. Moreover, import pressure could intensify in the absence of the measure due to global capacity growth and the proliferation of trade-defence measures worldwide.

Interested parties have 30 days from the opening date to register and submit written comments to the Morocco's Ministry of Industry and Commerce.`,

        title: "SSAB highlights minimal US tariff impact",
        date: "29/01/2026",
        content: `SSAB, which operates production sites in Europe and the USA, has so far seen only a limited direct impact of the US steel tariffs, chief executive Johnny Sjöström said during a conference call this week.

He underlined how SSAB is well-positioned with significant local production in the US. Only a limited volume of special products, especially high-strength steels for the automotive industry, are exported from the Nordics and shipped to North America, and many other overseas locations. 

Recently, “we have been selling some more volumes of special steels to the USA, but we don’t have to,” he said. If demand in the USA should go down, the group can divert deliveries to Europe easily, Kallanish heard him say during the call.

SSAB’s US operations at its SSAB Americas division were the main driver behind the group’s improved operating result of SEK 756 million ($86m) in the fourth quarter 2025, up from SEK 486m in Q4 2026. The group notes its strong position in the US heavy plate market was a notable factor that supported the result.

Over the full year, figures saw a year-on-year decline, due to lower steel prices in the group’s main regions. Operating profit fell by SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 6.1 billion, on revenue that dipped by SEK 7.2 billion to SEK 96 billion.

The group’s international setup and the global customer base for its special products are an advantage in principle. However, the nominal figures quoted in a strengthening Swedish krona are affected by a depreciated US dollar, in which most transactions are defined.

Shipments rose slightly at all three divisions, totalling 3.29 million tonnes at SSAB Europe, 1.84mt at SSAB Americas, and 1.24mt at SSAB Special Steels.

For the first quarter this year, the group predicts higher shipments for Europe and Special Steels, and slightly higher sales at Americas, which last year saw the highest volume increase. Prices are expected to climb “somewhat higher” than in Q4, except for Special Steels, which is subject to different market dynamics, and where price hikes will take effect with a delay (see Kallanish 29 January).`,

        content: `Voestalpine has agreed to divest Böhler Profil, a company in its High Performance Metals division, supplier of special profiles for a variety of industrial applications including industrial knives, Kallanish learns.

The buyer is US company Kadant, based in Webford, Massachusetts, with 3,900 employees in 22 countries worldwide. According to voestalpine, Kadant will retain the unit’s staff working at the production site in Bruckbach, Lower Austria.

The Austrian group is divesting the unit for strategic reasons and in line with the streamlining of the High Performance Metals division portfolio. “Kadant had repeatedly expressed interest in the company,” chief executive Herbert Eibensteiner notes on the occasion of the sale agreement.

In the business year 2024/25, Böhler Profil had a workforce of approximately 150 employees and generated revenue of €51.5 million ($61.6m). Over the past 15 years, voestalpine has invested a total of €23m in the Bruckbach site, for purposes including upgrading automation and digitalisation in profile manufacturing, the group highlights.

The spin-off follows the divestment of another unit of High Performance Metals, Buderus Edelstahl in Wetzlar, Germany, as well as site consolidations outside Austria, and capacity adjustments at voestalpine Böhler Bleche. With these measures, the High Performance Metals division has effectively completed the process of restructuring its portfolio, voestalpine states.`,

GPI can be used as oxygen converter coolant or as feedstock for electric arc furnaces, cupolas and induction furnaces.

TMC plans to reach its design capacity for granulated iron production by 2028. According to the project, the plant will have a capacity of 332,500 tonnes/year. Construction and installation work is expected to be completed in 2027, Kallanish notes.

Product is planned to be delivered by road to nearby consumers in Bashkortostan, the Volga Federal District, and the Urals Federal District, which have their own iron or steel furnaces.

Products for export to the CIS countries and China will be delivered by road and then transferred to rail for final delivery. The investor has reached preliminary agreements with consumers in Russia and China.`,

        content: `Chinese wire rod export prices fluctuated in January under the impact of the newly introduced export licencing policy. They initially rose in early January before retreating with weak demand, and then stabilised till the end of the month.

Kallanish assessed 6.5mm diameter mesh-grade wire rod at $475/tonne fob China, remaining stable on-week.

Wire rod export prices saw less movement towards the end of the month as overseas buying interest softened and China's construction steel market slipped into its pre-Lunar New Year lull. Most Chinese traders are offering wire rod export prices at $475-485/t fob China, for March shipment. 

Some traders also tell Kallanish they are looking for short-selling windows to lower shipment costs and attract buyers. However, VAT-evading wire rod export transactions appear to have almost disappeared from the market.

As China approaches the Lunar New Year holiday, logistics and port activity are expected to slow, implying a further weakening in wire rod export activity.`,

        title: "Domestic demand anchors India steel growth: economic survey",
        date: "29/01/2026",
        content: `India’s steel sector remains structurally demand-led, supported by infrastructure spending and construction demand, while major producers ramp up capacities, even as trade and input risks intensify.

The steel sector serves as the "backbone" of industrialisation and infrastructure, securing India’s position as the world's second-largest crude steel producer, according to the Economic Survey 2025-26 seen by Kallanish. The sector has undergone a "major transformation" in the last five years, primarily driven by strong domestic demand from the construction and manufacturing sectors.

Crude steel output has risen from 103.54 million tonnes in the fiscal year ending March 2021 (FY21) to 152.18mt in FY25, equivalent to a 10.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Finished steel production increased from 96.2mt to 146.69mt over the same period, implying 11.1% CAGR.

Steel consumption has grown even more rapidly, up from 94.89mt in FY21 to 152.13mt in FY25, translating into a 12.5% CAGR. This reflects sustained demand from infrastructure, housing and manufacturing.

Momentum carried into FY26. In the first half of FY26, crude steel production increased 11.7% on-year, finished steel output rose 10.8%, while consumption expanded 7.8%.

External pressures have also emerged. The survey flags pricing and raw material risks, noting: “The sector faces challenges related to international price disparity and raw material security. India was a net importer of steel during FY26 (April-October), primarily due to low international prices which resulted in lower margins on exports and cheaper imports.”

Raw material security remains a structural constraint. While India is largely self-sufficient in iron ore, dependence on imported coking coal persists. To mitigate supply risks, the government’s Mission Coking Coal is targeting domestic raw coking coal production of 140mt by 2030 (see separate article).

Policy support remains central to the sector’s medium-term positioning. Under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for specialty steel, cumulative investment reached INR 230.22 billion ($2.5 billion) by October 2025, significantly exceeding the approved outlay of INR 63.22 billion. Specialty steel output under the scheme stood at 2.34mt, indicating gradual progress towards higher-value production.

The survey positions steel as a core enabler of India’s investment cycle. Construction accounted for 7.8% of GDP in FY26, while gross fixed capital formation stood at 30% of GDP, reinforcing steel’s reliance on domestic capital expenditure rather than export demand.

Overall, the survey points to a steady but more contested outlook. Domestic demand and policy continuity provide support, but international price volatility and input security risks are set to shape margins and trade flows through 2025-26.`,

        title: "Expansion of CBAM will increase revenues from the mechanism by 23%",
        date: "30/01/2026",
        content: `The EC also defends temporary deviation from conditions for fertilizers
The expansion of the European Cross-Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to increase revenues from it by 23%, potentially bringing in an additional €500 million by 2030. This was reported by EUobserver.

This step also includes taking scrap into account for consumption.

Speaking at a meeting of the European Parliament’s Environment Committee on January 27, European Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra recalled that CBAM had been extended to approximately 180 product types, mostly goods containing steel and aluminum. This move is intended to prevent companies from avoiding carbon taxes by carrying out the most polluting production operations outside the EU and then sending the finished products back to the bloc.

Hookstra also clarified that the expansion would be “narrowly targeted” and would only apply to products where there is a high risk of circumvention, rather than complex industrial goods such as cars.

Some MEPs criticized the CBAM simplification package at the meeting. However, the European Commissioner for Climate Action pointed out that 99% of emissions are still covered by the mechanism, adding that it is extremely important to reduce the administrative burden without weakening the impact on the climate.

He added that the new threshold would be subject to annual assessment based on updated trade flows and emissions data, as well as a review clause that would allow the EC to adjust the system if it did not work.

The European Commission will also introduce stricter rules to combat carbon tax evasion, including the use of default values for countries if importers do not provide reliable emissions data.

In addition, Huxtra defended the temporary exemption from CBAM requirements for fertilizers, citing pressure on farmers and the risk of price increases. According to him, the European fertilizer industry is operating at 30% below capacity and is generally more environmentally friendly than imports, a significant portion of which still come from Russia.

The European Commissioner added that if a choice has to be made, it is better to help European farmers.

It should be recalled that in January this year, the European Commission proposed a provision on the temporary suspension of the cross-border carbon adjustment mechanism for goods in serious and unforeseen circumstances – a new Article 27a in the relevant regulation.`,

In 2025, Austrian steel companies increased steel production by 5.9% compared to 2024, to 620 thousand tons. The country ranks 20th in the WorldSteel global ranking of steel producers.

In December, steel production by Austrian steelmakers increased by 10.9% compared to December 2024, reaching 620,000 tons. Compared to the previous month, the figure rose by 2.3%.

Recently, the country’s main steel producer, Voestalpine AG, announced the possibility of reducing production capacity at two of its plants in the country: Voestalpine Tubulars in Kindberg and BÖHLER Bleche in Mürzzuschlag. The reason for the adjustments is pressure from US tariffs and insufficient demand for steel.

The company had previously highlighted problems with production costs and competitiveness. The manufacturer appealed to the authorities to renew the mechanism for compensating energy-intensive enterprises for the cost of electricity.

Overall, EU steel companies increased steel production by 3.9% y/y – to 9.9 million tons in December 2025, while reducing it by 0.9% y/y – to 42.8 million tons for the year.

As reported by GMK Center, Austria produced 7.1 million tons of steel in 2024, which is in line with the 2023 level. The country ranked 23rd in the global ranking of steel-producing countries, while in 2022 it ranked 22nd.

Austria is home to two Voestalpine steel plants: Voestalpine Stahl Linz with a capacity of 6 million tons of steel per year and Voestalpine Stahl Donawitz with a capacity of 1.57 million tons per year.`,

        content: `In Q4, the EU and eurozone economies grew by 0.3% q/q, maintaining a moderate recovery trajectory
In 2025, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the European Union grew by 1.6% year-on-year, while the eurozone economy added 1.5%. This is evidenced by Eurostat’s preliminary estimate.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, GDP increased by 1.4% year-on-year in the EU and by 1.3% year-on-year in the eurozone, indicating a gradual but modest recovery in economic activity at the end of the year. On a quarterly basis, seasonally adjusted GDP grew by 0.3% q/q in both the European Union and the eurozone. Thus, growth rates in the eurozone remained at the previous quarter’s level, while in the EU they slowed slightly from 0.4% in the third quarter to 0.3%.

Among the member states, the highest quarterly growth was recorded in Lithuania (+1.7%). Spain and Portugal showed the same dynamics at +0.8% q/q. At the same time, Ireland was the only country where GDP declined on a quarterly basis, by 0.6%. In annual terms, 14 countries showed positive economic dynamics, while in one country the indicator remained unchanged.

The dynamics of the bloc’s largest economies remained uneven. In Q4, Germany’s GDP grew by 0.3% q/q, France’s by 0.2% q/q, and Italy’s also by 0.3% q/q, while Spain showed a stronger recovery of +0.8% q/q. In annual terms, growth in these countries ranged from 0.4% in Germany to 2.6% in Spain, highlighting the varying speeds of recovery among the EU’s leading economies.

According to Eurostat estimates, the EU’s GDP grew by 1% in 2024 compared to 2023. In the eurozone, this figure increased by 0.9% y/y.

In the fourth quarter, seasonally adjusted EU GDP grew by 0.4% compared to the previous quarter and by 1.4% compared to the same period in 2023. In the eurozone, the indicator grew by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter and by 1.2% year-on-year.`,

        content: `The country notes that its steel industry does not contribute to the global excess capacity
Switzerland insists on exemption from the EU’s planned new protective measures on steel imports and has convened a special meeting with representatives of the bloc on trade issues. This is stated in a report by the country’s government.

A meeting of delegates from both sides to discuss trade barriers took place in Brussels on January 29.

According to the Swiss government, steel production in the country does not contribute to global overcapacity. Instead, it supports the functioning of regional supply chains that are crucial to European industrial ecosystems.

“Switzerland is continuing its efforts to find a solution with the EU that will preserve trade as much as possible,” the statement said.

In addition to steel, Switzerland will focus on exemption from EU protective measures restricting imports of certain manganese and silicon-based alloys (ferroalloys). The country also expressed concern about the possibility of the EU imposing restrictions on the export of aluminum scrap.

As a reminder, in October 2025, the European Commission presented a proposal to protect the EU steel industry from the unfair impact of global overcapacity. It provides for limiting duty-free imports to 18.3 million tons per year and doubling the duty rate on products outside the quota to 50% (compared to 25% under the current safeguard measure). The EC has announced its intention to work closely with the bloc’s trading partners affected by this tariff change within the WTO to offer them quotas for individual countries.

The bloc plans to make exceptions to its new safeguard measures only for countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) – Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.`,

        content: `Ukraine’s energy system, designed during the Soviet era with enormous reserves to power industrial giants, has suffered critical damage. During the spring and summer shelling campaign of 2024, Ukraine lost more than 9 GW of generating capacity. For comparison, this is equivalent to the total consumption of several European countries. More than 50% of the country’s total generation capacity was destroyed or occupied, including Europe’s largest Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (6 GW) and a number of key thermal power plants (Trypilska, Zmiivska).

Despite the heroic efforts of energy workers to restore power, the winter of 2025–2026 became the most difficult test. The January 2026 attacks on transmission substations and generation facilities led to the introduction of strict consumption limits, which in some industrial regions (Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions) reached the level of emergency blackouts.

The National Bank predicts that the electricity deficit will continue until the end of 2026. This means that energy restrictions are becoming the “new normal,” which will hold GDP growth at -0.5% in 2026 due to this factor alone.`,
