        date: "30/01/2026",
        content:
          `The EC also defends temporary deviation from conditions for fertilizers
The expansion of the European Cross-Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to increase revenues from it by 23%, potentially bringing in an additional €500 million by 2030. This was reported by EUobserver.

This step also includes taking scrap into account for consumption.

Speaking at a meeting of the European Parliament’s Environment Committee on January 27, European Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra recalled that CBAM had been extended to approximately 180 product types, mostly goods containing steel and aluminum. This move is intended to prevent companies from avoiding carbon taxes by carrying out the most polluting production operations outside the EU and then sending the finished products back to the bloc.

Hookstra also clarified that the expansion would be “narrowly targeted” and would only apply to products where there is a high risk of circumvention, rather than complex industrial goods such as cars.

Some MEPs criticized the CBAM simplification package at the meeting. However, the European Commissioner for Climate Action pointed out that 99% of emissions are still covered by the mechanism, adding that it is extremely important to reduce the administrative burden without weakening the impact on the climate.

He added that the new threshold would be subject to annual assessment based on updated trade flows and emissions data, as well as a review clause that would allow the EC to adjust the system if it did not work.

The European Commission will also introduce stricter rules to combat carbon tax evasion, including the use of default values for countries if importers do not provide reliable emissions data.

In addition, Huxtra defended the temporary exemption from CBAM requirements for fertilizers, citing pressure on farmers and the risk of price increases. According to him, the European fertilizer industry is operating at 30% below capacity and is generally more environmentally friendly than imports, a significant portion of which still come from Russia.

The European Commissioner added that if a choice has to be made, it is better to help European farmers.

It should be recalled that in January this year, the European Commission proposed a provision on the temporary suspension of the cross-border carbon adjustment mechanism for goods in serious and unforeseen circumstances – a new Article 27a in the relevant regulation.`,

        date: "30/01/2026",
        content:
          `In Q4, the EU and eurozone economies grew by 0.3% q/q, maintaining a moderate recovery trajectory
In 2025, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the European Union grew by 1.6% year-on-year, while the eurozone economy added 1.5%. This is evidenced by Eurostat’s preliminary estimate.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, GDP increased by 1.4% year-on-year in the EU and by 1.3% year-on-year in the eurozone, indicating a gradual but modest recovery in economic activity at the end of the year. On a quarterly basis, seasonally adjusted GDP grew by 0.3% q/q in both the European Union and the eurozone. Thus, growth rates in the eurozone remained at the previous quarter’s level, while in the EU they slowed slightly from 0.4% in the third quarter to 0.3%.

Among the member states, the highest quarterly growth was recorded in Lithuania (+1.7%). Spain and Portugal showed the same dynamics at +0.8% q/q. At the same time, Ireland was the only country where GDP declined on a quarterly basis, by 0.6%. In annual terms, 14 countries showed positive economic dynamics, while in one country the indicator remained unchanged.

The dynamics of the bloc’s largest economies remained uneven. In Q4, Germany’s GDP grew by 0.3% q/q, France’s by 0.2% q/q, and Italy’s also by 0.3% q/q, while Spain showed a stronger recovery of +0.8% q/q. In annual terms, growth in these countries ranged from 0.4% in Germany to 2.6% in Spain, highlighting the varying speeds of recovery among the EU’s leading economies.

According to Eurostat estimates, the EU’s GDP grew by 1% in 2024 compared to 2023. In the eurozone, this figure increased by 0.9% y/y.

In the fourth quarter, seasonally adjusted EU GDP grew by 0.4% compared to the previous quarter and by 1.4% compared to the same period in 2023. In the eurozone, the indicator grew by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter and by 1.2% year-on-year.

        date: "30/01/2026",
        content:
          `The country notes that its steel industry does not contribute to the global excess capacity
Switzerland insists on exemption from the EU’s planned new protective measures on steel imports and has convened a special meeting with representatives of the bloc on trade issues. This is stated in a report by the country’s government.

A meeting of delegates from both sides to discuss trade barriers took place in Brussels on January 29.

According to the Swiss government, steel production in the country does not contribute to global overcapacity. Instead, it supports the functioning of regional supply chains that are crucial to European industrial ecosystems.

Switzerland is continuing its efforts to find a solution with the EU that will preserve trade as much as possible, the statement said.

In addition to steel, Switzerland will focus on exemption from EU protective measures restricting imports of certain manganese and silicon-based alloys (ferroalloys). The country also expressed concern about the possibility of the EU imposing restrictions on the export of aluminum scrap.

As a reminder, in October 2025, the European Commission presented a proposal to protect the EU steel industry from the unfair impact of global overcapacity. It provides for limiting duty-free imports to 18.3 million tons per year and doubling the duty rate on products outside the quota to 50% (compared to 25% under the current safeguard measure). The EC has announced its intention to work closely with the bloc’s trading partners affected by this tariff change within the WTO to offer them quotas for individual countries.

The bloc plans to make exceptions to its new safeguard measures only for countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) – Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.`,

        date: "30/01/2026",
        content:
          `Ukraine’s energy system, designed during the Soviet era with enormous reserves to power industrial giants, has suffered critical damage. During the spring and summer shelling campaign of 2024, Ukraine lost more than 9 GW of generating capacity. For comparison, this is equivalent to the total consumption of several European countries. More than 50% of the country’s total generation capacity was destroyed or occupied, including Europe’s largest Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (6 GW) and a number of key thermal power plants (Trypilska, Zmiivska).

Despite the heroic efforts of energy workers to restore power, the winter of 2025–2026 became the most difficult test. The January 2026 attacks on transmission substations and generation facilities led to the introduction of strict consumption limits, which in some industrial regions (Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions) reached the level of emergency blackouts.

The National Bank predicts that the electricity deficit will continue until the end of 2026. This means that energy restrictions are becoming the “new normal,” which will hold GDP growth at -0.5% in 2026 due to this factor alone.`,
